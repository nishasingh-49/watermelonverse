# WatermelonVerse

> _Where your tasks turn into juicy watermelon slices._  
> Finish your to-dos, grow your garden, and unlock *pure chaos* in the cutest way possible.<br>
Because regular to-do lists are boring.
Watermelons? Not boring.
Cute chaos? Even better.
We built this during an internship to make productivity a little more fun, chaotic, and watermelon aesthetics and obviously to show my love for watermelonsss teheee ;)

## What is this?

**WatermelonVerse** is not your regular productivity app. Itâ€™s a **whimsical digital garden** where:

-Every task you complete = 1 watermelon slice on your grid  
-Finish 'em all? You get confetti, sparkles, hype dance, and the sacred **BubBook**  
-Toggle between sunny vibes and cozy dark mode  
-A funky lilâ€™ character pops in to say: **"PROUD OF YOU BUB"** (yes, we scream in caps)  
-All chaos is controlled by **React + Tailwind + glitter**
